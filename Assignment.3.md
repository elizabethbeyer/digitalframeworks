# Pivot counties in 2016 vs. the 2018 midterms

* I'm interested in researching pivot counties in swing states that consistenly voted blue for at least four general elections before 2016. I want to see how they're polling now and their forecast for the midterms. I also want to talk to voters and election officials to see what happened, how they felt leading up to the 2016, after the 2016 election once the 24 hour Trump newscycle really started heating up, and going into the 2018 midterms.
* I want to know the size of the county, the state that the county is in, the voting history of the county and any significant demographic shifts between 2012 and 2016 and between 2016 and 2018. 
* To collect the data, I would figure out which counties in the swing states pivoted, then I would reach out to the board of elections in that county or hunt for their voter history on the board of elections website. 
* Here's my data! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kjBlqOCS5DrohhgBVxCIys0w8MLCGO21j2mp7d0CZA8/edit?usp=sharing

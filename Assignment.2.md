Hello Editor!

I understand you're uncomfortable with the data I'm using to write the story about U.S. Constitutional Amendments from 1788 to 2014, but rest assured. I have examined this data very closely to be sure we won't fall under that pesky "fake news" catagory.
* I've sorted each section to be sure there aren't any outliers or missing chunks of data in any of the catagories. 
* Then I made sure the most common phone number, and that date in 1970 (unless an amendment was passed on that day) were not in the data.
* Then I called a historian and spent the next 100 hours with them looking each amendment up in the history books. 
* Then I put the data into a chart to make sure all points would fall within the variables.
* Then I contacted the Library of Congress to make sure all of the lawmakers listed actually existed. 
* Then I ran the data set through Open Refine to clean up any loose ends. 
* Finally I charted the cleaned data and everything added up!

This story is going to be great, don't worry!

Kind regards,

Your fearless reporter

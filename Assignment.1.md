# FiveThirtyEight readers launch a trade war 

International trade and the president have been in the news with new tarrifs imposed on Chinese imports. Following China's "tit-for-tat" response, news outlets are calling the exchange between nations a trade war and so the brilliant minds that brought their readers a game about a [nuclear standoff](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/thank-god-you-people-dont-have-the-nuclear-codes/) decided to give their readers a spin in the power seat. And then used the data to create visualizations of the results. 
To make the game work, FiveThirtyEight offered three character traits found in a president:

1. Friendliness
2. Imitation
3. Vindictiveness 

This provided an intimate look into the personalities of their readers. According to the data, the readers started off with good intentions with the majority of them pushing friendliness in the mid to high 70 percentage. But as time wore on, friendliness dropped to mid 60 percent, vindictiveness increased dramatically after the first few plays and imitation stayed pretty much the same. 
This data story is particularly interesting because readers of another [FiveThirtyEight story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-win-a-trade-war/) provided the data. The outlet made one interactive data story to feed another interactive story data.  That's genius. 

In case you're curious, I did play the game (a few times) and through my own (fun) analysis I feel safe in making the claim that it's possibe to achieve free trade if you're a 100 percent friendly president, with relatively low leves of imitation and vindictiveness.
